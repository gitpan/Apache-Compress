NAME
    Apache::Compress - Auto-compress web files with Gzip

SYNOPSIS
      PerlModule Apache::Compress
      
      # Compress regular files
      <FilesMatch "\.blah$">
       PerlHandler Apache::Compress
      </FilesMatch>
      
      # Compress output of Perl scripts
      PerlModule Apache::Filter
      <FilesMatch "\.pl$">
       PerlSetVar Filter on
       PerlHandler Apache::RegistryFilter Apache::Compress
      </FilesMatch>

DESCRIPTION
    This module lets you send the content of an HTTP response as gzip-
    compressed data. Certain browsers (Netscape, IE) can request content
    compression via the `Content-Encoding' header. This can speed things up
    if you're sending large files to your users through slow connections.

    Browsers that don't request gzipped data will receive regular
    noncompressed data.

    This module is compatibile with Apache::Filter, so you can compress the
    output of other content-generators.

TO DO
    Compress::Zlib provides a facility for buffering output until there's
    enough data for efficient compression. Currently we don't take advantage
    of this facility, we simply compress the whole content body at once. We
    could achieve better memory usage if we changed this (at a small cost to
    the compression ratio). See Eagle book, p.185.

    Partially based on the work of several modules, like Doug MacEachern's
    Apache::Gzip (in the Eagle book but not on CPAN), Andreas Koenig's
    Apache::GzipChain, and an unreleased module by Geoffrey Young and
    Philippe Chiasson.
