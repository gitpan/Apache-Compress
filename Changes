Version: 1.003  Date: 2000/11/05 05:36:46
   Updated code to work with Apache::Filter 1.013 and greater.  If you're
   using Apache::Filter 1.012 or lower, you must use 2.14 or lower of
   Apache::Compress.  If you don't use Apache::Filter, you don't need to
   care.
   
   Added Compress::Zlib to the PREREQ_PM list in Makefile.PL.


Version: 1.002  Date: 2000/08/22 05:30:11
   First release.  Rewrote code to be a bit cleaner.  Changed name from
   Apache::Gzip to Apache::Compress, because Apache::Gzip is taken by a
   sample module in the Eagle book.
   
   Wrote some bare-bones documentation, but it probably needs more.


Version: 1.001  Date: 2000/05/31 01:43:20
   First revision.  Based on code that Geoffrey Young and Philippe
   Chiasson were working on a while back, but abandoned.  They based
   theirs on Apache::GzipChain.
