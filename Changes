Revision history for Perl extension Apache::Compress

1.005  Wed Nov 17 13:59:58 CST 2004

 - Fixed the documentation by adding a 'SetHandler perl-script' line
   to each example. [Andy Lester]

1.004  Sun Apr 18 21:37:16 CDT 2004

 - Added the 'CompressDecision' configuration variable to control how
   the decision to compress is made.  Rudimentary support for
   user-agent sniffing is available.

 - I think print() was buffering very short documents so they wouldn't
   ever be output.  $r->print() seems to work better.

 - Squelched a couple of warnings about undefined values. [Spotted by
   Dave Rolsky]

 - Added a Build.PL script that users can use instead of Makefile.PL
   if they want.  Not surprisingly, it's a lot cleaner than the
   Makefile.PL.

 - Fixed some quoting problems when reading the user's existing
   httpd.conf for testing purposes.

 - The regression tests now use Test.pm.


1.003  date: 2000/11/05 05:36:46

 - Updated code to work with Apache::Filter 1.013 and greater.  If
   you're using Apache::Filter 1.012 or lower, you must use 2.14 or
   lower of Apache::Compress.  If you don't use Apache::Filter, you
   don't need to care.

 - Added Compress::Zlib to the PREREQ_PM list in Makefile.PL.


1.002  date: 2000/08/22 05:30:11

 - First release on CPAN.  Rewrote code to be a bit cleaner.  Changed
   name from Apache::Gzip to Apache::Compress, because Apache::Gzip is
   taken by a sample module in the Eagle book.

 - Wrote some bare-bones documentation, but it probably needs more.


1.001  date: 2000/05/31 01:43:20

 - First revision, never released.  Based on code that Geoffrey Young
   and Philippe Chiasson were working on a while back, but abandoned.
   They based theirs on Apache::GzipChain.
